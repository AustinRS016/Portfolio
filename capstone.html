				<h2>Abstract for Capstone Project</h2>
				<br>
					<p>	Salmon and steelhead hatcheries, while increasingly contentious, provide a number of benefits to humans and the environment. They provide sustainable fishing opportunities where natural fish populations cannot handle fishing pressure, they have been known to recover natural fish populations and now increasingly they provide substantial amounts of food for residential orca whales in the salish sea. Salmon hatcheries can provide great fishing opportunities on a river for anyone willing to do their research. The first thing a salmon or steelhead angler wanting to fish in a river needs to do, if they are to be successful, is to find out if the river flow conditions and hatchery reports indicate that there will be fish in the river and thus an optimal time to fish. Run timings vary species by species and river by river. In order to better understand and anticipate the timing of salmon and steelhead returns a statistical analysis using regression will be conducted based on historic river flow and hatchery return data. The results of the analysis will show when salmon and steelhead are predicted to return, and how dependent on river levels the return is. A live web map will be created styling each river based on how suitable the conditions are for fish to return to the hatchery depending on run timing and the dependency on river levels for fish to make it  upstream. Additionally, each hatchery will be featured on the map with the option to explore statistics on salmon and steelhead escapement trends. The end result gives an angler an advantage to deciding what river to fish and also provides insight to anyone interested in the nuances of salmon and steelhead returning to hatcheries.
